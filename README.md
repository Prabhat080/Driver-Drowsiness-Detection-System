# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System

# Built driver drowsiness detection system.
# The system alerts the driver, if the eyes of the driver remain closed in more than 15 continuous image frames taken from real time video recording.
# Used 68_face_shape_predictor facial landmark to get points on the eyes which is later used to detect the eye blink.
# Exposure: OpenCV, Dlib, github.
